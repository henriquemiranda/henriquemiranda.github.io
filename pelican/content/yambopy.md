Lattely I started using Yambo to calculate GW corrections and optical absorptions spectra of some materials. As any of you that run this type of calculations before can testify, the convergence tests can sometimes be a rather daunting task.
To help with that we created yambopy, a pytohn library to make these convergence tests a little bit easier.

This library is still in and early development phase, feel free to contribute with suggestions, patches and bug reports.
