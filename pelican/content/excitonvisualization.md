Title: Exciton visualization website

I started implementing an exciton visualization website.

It uses yambo ypp to generate a representation of electron density when the hole is fixed.
It does so for the excitons with the highest intensity.
The user can then click in the absorption spectra and visualize the electron density that corresponds to that particular state.

Although still under development, you can already visit it and check the progress:
