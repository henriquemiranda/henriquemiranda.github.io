Who has never played the famous snake arcade game?

If you didn't, you have three options:

+ travel back in time to when everyone had a Nokia with the game of snake,
+ go further back in time to when snake was the 'best game ever',
+ time-travel to when all one could do on a saturday night was try to avoid getting bitten by snakes,
+ just download and compile my implementation of this popular arcade game.

In this implementation you can play snake using your unix terminal.

Compilation instructions
=========================
