Today published online the phonon visualization website.
This project aims to provide a simple way to visualize the lattice vibrations of different materials.

This is the continuation of the work of Raul Weber during an internship in the University of Luxembourg during 2 months under the supervisions of Ludger Wirtz and technical help from me. I decided to continue the project by optimizing the implementation, cleaning up the design and replacing JSmol by a self made applet which I will call VibCrystal.
