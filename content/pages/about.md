Welcome!
My name is Henrique Pereira Coutada Miranda.
Currently I am a PhD student in Physics and Materials Science at the University of Luxembourg.

Here you will find small scripts, games and programs that I implemented and want to share with everyone.
Most of these projects are still under development.

If you have any suggestions or questions send an e-mail to:
