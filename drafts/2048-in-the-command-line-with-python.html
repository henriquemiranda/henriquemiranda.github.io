</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Some time ago I heard about a new game that is stealing the time of
many innocent and unknowing people. The game goes by the name of 2048, you can check 
out the original implementation in:
https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/</p>
<p>I always have a terrible time with this kind of simple games because they:
- follow very basic and simple to understand rules,
- are extremely addictive,
- suck up all the life from you and spit it back in the form of a dirty sock.</p>
<p>So, what to do when such game appears and you are in danger of loosing hours and hours of your life playing it?
You loose hours and hours of your life programming the computer to beat it.
Once you do that you are finally free to continue your normal live.
The first step in programming the computer to beat a game of 2048 is to teach it how to play it.
This is what I did and will show in this post.</p>
